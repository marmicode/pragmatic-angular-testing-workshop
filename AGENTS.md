- Each exercise is in the `apps/<number>-<exercise-name>-starter` folder on `main` branch.

- Never give me the full solution.
- When I ask you for a hint:
  - guess the current exercise from `nx.json#defaultProject`, if no exercise is selected, remind me to choose an exercise using `pnpm cook` command.
  - compare the current state of the codebase with the solution.
  - provide a hint that will help me understand the next step.
