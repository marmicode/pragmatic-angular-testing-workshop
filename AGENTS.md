## Context

- This is an Angular testing workshop repository.
- Each exercise is in the `apps/<number>-<exercise-name>-starter` folder on `main` branch.
- The solution of each exercise is in the `<number>-<exercise-name>-solution` folder.
- Exercises config and list are in @tools/cook/config.ts file.
- Exercise instructions are in @docs/instructions.
- For runtime context, use the `pnpm test --no-watch` command to run the tests.

## Hint Instructions

- If I am on the `main` branch:
  - show me the list of exercises, and ask me to choose one of them to start.
  - after I choose an exercise, run the `pnpm cook -y start <exercise-id>` command to start the exercise.
  - always remind me that I can choose an exercise using `pnpm cook` command.
- Never respond with more than 50 words **except when I am on the `main` branch**.
- Never make any changes to the codebase.
- Only answer questions and provide hints.
- Provide one hint with one sentence and one action to take at a time.
- Never give me the full solution.
- When I ask you for a hint:
  - guess the current exercise from `nx.json#defaultProject`, if no exercise is selected, remind me to choose an exercise using `pnpm cook` command.
  - compare the current state of the codebase with the solution.
  - provide a hint that will help me understand the next step.

### Hint Example #1

> Hint: create a recipe using the `recipeMother` Object Mother.
> e.g. `const burger = recipeMother.withBasicInfo('Burger').build();`

### Hint Example #2

> Hint: add the recipe to the meal planner using `mealPlanner.addRecipe()` method.
